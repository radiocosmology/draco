    r"""Baseclass for down-mixing or up-mixing visibilities as a function of time.

    Also known as fringestopping.  This task multiplies the visibilities by a
    complex sinusoid in local earth rotation angle :math:`{\phi}`:

    .. math::
        V_{ij}^{downmixed} = V_{ij} * exp(j \omega \phi)

    where the angular frequency :math:`{\omega}` is set by instantaneous fringe rate
    at the centre of the field of view:

    .. math::
        \omega = 2 \pi b_{ew} cos(\delta) / \lambda

    where :math:`b_{ew}` is the east-west baseline distance, :math:`{\delta}`
    is the declination of the centre of the field of view, and :math:`{\lambda}`
    is the wavelength.  This will remove the fringe pattern that would be observed
    in the signal from a point source located at the centre of the field of view.
    This will enable further downsampling in time, assuming the field of view is
    sufficiently small.

    Can also be thought of as applying a baseline, declination, and frequency
    dependent shift in m-mode space.
