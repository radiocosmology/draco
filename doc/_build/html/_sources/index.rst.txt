draco
=====

A basic pipeline for the analysis and simulation of drift scan radio data.

The purpose of the CHIME pipeline is to analyse timestream data, turning it into
maps and power spectra, and to do the reverse, take (synthetic) maps and turn
them into realistic simulated timestream data. This is intended as quick
tutorial for how to install, set-up and run the pipeline, as well as a reference
to the API documentation.
